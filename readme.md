# Video Processing Experiments

This repository contains experiments and examples of video and image processing
using OpenCV, WebRTC, and other technologies.

It was created by [The Concord Consortium](http://www.concord.org) for the
[Learning Everywhere](http://concord.org/learning-everywhere/) project.

All code should be considered alpha-quality.

## Examples

### opencv

Color detection and shape tracking using OpenCV.

### opencv-nodejs-browser

Image processing in the browser using WebRTC sent to OpenCV via node-opencv.

* **shape-detection** — Edge-detection using Canny, and polygon approximation
* **color-detection** — HSV color-detection
* **user-calibration** — Extension of the above with calibration sliders

### js-canvas

Image processing using pure Javascript on the canvas

* **color-detection** - Color detection and contour-finding
* **color-detection2** - Faster color detection and contour-finding
* **video-user-calibration** - Processing of video feed plus in-page calibrations
